# Advertisement_Clicked_or_Not_Using_ML_with_Logistic-Regression

`ML micro-project using Logistic Regression` :

In this project we will work with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an advertisement. 

`We will create a logistic regression model that will predict whether or not a user will click on an ad, based on his/her features. As this is a binary classification problem, a logistic regression model is well suited here.`
